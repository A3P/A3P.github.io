            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me">
                I'm a student at the University of Victoria, majoring in Computer Science.
                My passion for Web Development drove me to the degree I'm currently studying for,
                however most of my knowledge is obtained through self-learning!
                I'm always on the lookout for the newest technologies to add to my arsenal of skills.
                React has caught my attention at the moment and I'll be tinkering with it for the forseeable future.
                <br></br>
                When I'm not studying in front of my screens and books, I can be found
                playing soccer and tennis with friends, practicing on guitar and or piano,
                or trying my hand at art (A sample of one of my scratch arts can be found as my Github profile picture).
